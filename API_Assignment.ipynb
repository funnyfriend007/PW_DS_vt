    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. In the context of APIs, the word Application refers to any software\n",
    "with a distinct function. Interface can be thought of as a contract of service between two applications. \n",
    "This contract defines how the two communicate with each other using requests and responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server. The application sending the request is \n",
    "called the client, and the application sending the response is called the server. So in the weather example, \n",
    "the bureau’s weather database is the server, and the mobile app is the client. \n",

    "This is a less flexible API that was more popular in the past.\n",
    "\n",
    "RPC APIs\n",
    "These APIs are called Remote Procedure Calls. The client completes a function (or procedure) on the server, \n",
    "and the server sends the output back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "Websocket APIs\n",
    "Websocket API is another modern web API development that uses JSON objects to pass data. A WebSocket API \n",
    "supports two-way communication between client apps and the server. The server can send callback messages to connected clients, making it more efficient than REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "REST APIs - REST - representational state transfer. Protocol\n",
    "These are the most popular and flexible APIs found on the web today. The client sends requests to the server as data. \n",
    "The server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client. \n",

    "REST is a software architectural style that defines the set of rules to be used for creating web services.\n",

    "It allows requesting systems to access and manipulate web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of rules. \n",
    "Interaction in REST based systems happen through Internet’s Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). \n",
    "\n",
    "A Restful system consists of a:\n",

    "a)client who requests for the resources.\n",
    "b)server who has the resources.\n",
    "It is important to create REST API according to industry standards which results in ease of development and increase client adoption. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rules of REST API: There are certain rules which should be kept in mind while creating REST API endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "1)REST is based on the resource or noun instead of action or verb based. It means that a URI of a REST API should always end with a noun. \n",
    "Example: /api/users is a good example, but /api?type=users is a bad example of creating a REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)HTTP verbs are used to identify the action. Some of the HTTP verbs are – GET, PUT, POST, DELETE, GET, PATCH.\n",
    "\n",
    "3)A web application should be organized into resources like users and then uses \n",
    "HTTP verbs like – GET, PUT, POST, DELETE to modify those resources. \n",

    "SOAP or Simple Objects Access Protocol is a web communication protocol designed for Microsoft back in 1998.\n",
    "Today, it’s mostly used to expose web services and transmit data over HTTP/HTTPS. \n",
    "But it’s not limited to them. SOAP, unlike the REST pattern, supports the XML data format only and \n",
    "strongly follows preset standards such as messaging structure, a set of encoding rules, \n",
    "and a convention for providing procedure requests and responses.\n",
